## Register and login user in the Django app

Go to http://localhost:8000/admin and create a new user.

## Access API

### Getting authentication token

To get authentication token use:

```bash
./scripts/get_token.py --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> | jq -r .access
```

Default data fixture is using `opiekun1` both for username and password.

### Auth

To run app with tokens, set `.local.env` `ENVIRONMENT` to `PROD`.

Go to http://localhost:8000/api/users/register/

You may use Postman for that.

As you can see below, you can fill the body form-data with info:

![](https://github.com/zetonteam/zeton_django/blob/develop/images/postman_register_01.png?raw=true)

After that you can hit http://localhost:8000/api/users/students/ with GET method and put into Headers key and value.

Then you have access to private endpoint.

More private endpoints:

Go to http://localhost:8000/api/users/students/

You may expect this result:

```
[
    {
        "pk": 1,
        "email": "wojtek-zeton@mailinator.com",
        "username": "wojtek",
        "first_name": "Wojtek",
        "last_name": "",
        "total_points": 250
    },
    {
        "pk": 2,
        "email": "kuba-zeton@mailinator.com",
        "username": "kuba",
        "first_name": "Kuba",
        "last_name": "",
        "total_points": 120
    }
]
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/api/users/students/1

Result:

```
{
    "pk": 1,
    "email": "wojtek-zeton@mailinator.com",
    "username": "wojtek",
    "first_name": "Wojtek",
    "last_name": "",
    "total_points": 250
}
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/api/users/prizes/

```
[
    {
        "pk": 1,
        "student": "1",
        "name": "Puszka Coca-cola",
        "value": 10
    },
    {
        "pk": 2,
        "student": "2",
        "name": "1 godzina na basenie",
        "value": 30
    }
]
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/api/users/prizes/1

Result:

```
{
    "pk": 1,
    "student": "1",
    "name": "Puszka Coca-cola",
    "value": 10
}
```

Similarly, tasks:

Go to
http://localhost:8000/api/users/tasks/
http://localhost:8000/api/users/tasks/1

## Points endpoints

There are currently several enpoints responsible for managing student points available:

1. `api/users/points/` accesible with a `GET` request and followed by a query string pointing to a student primary
   key.
   For example: `api/users/points/?studentId=2` should return Point instances assigned to the student with `pk=2`

2. `api/users/points/` accessible with `POST` request, payload in a given format is required:

```
{
    "value": 40,
    "assigner": 1,
    "student": 1,
}
```

As a result you should receive a response similar to the following:

```
{
    "pk": 5,
    "value": 40,
    "assigner": 1,
    "student": 1,
    "assignment_date": "2021-01-26T21:41:04.952509Z"
}
```


### Tests

There are also some tests, checking above endpoints, available in the `users/tests/users/test_points.py` module.

To execute the tests simply call `docker compose exec web pytest` (you can add the `-v` flag for a verbose ouput).
